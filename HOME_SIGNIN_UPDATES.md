## 📝 Implementation Details

### FeaturedDeals Changes:
```tsx
// Before: Static "Reserve" button
<Button variant="default" size="sm">
  Reserve
</Button>

// After: "Add to Cart" with functionality
<Button 
  variant="default" 
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => handleAddToCart(deal)}
>
  Add to Cart
</Button>
```

### Price Conversion Formula:
```
USD to INR: multiply by 30 (approximate rate)
- $25 → ₹750
- $8 → ₹240 (maintains same discount %)
```

### Email Validation Regex:
```tsx
const gmailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@gmail\.com$/;
```

### Password Validation Regex:
```tsx
const passwordRegex = 
  /^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])(?=.*\d).{8,}$/;
// Requires: uppercase, lowercase, special char, digit, 8+ chars
```
